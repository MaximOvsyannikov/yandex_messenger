# "base" is the directory to change to before starting build. If you set base:
#        that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc, not repo root!
# "command" is your build command.
# "publish" is the directory to publish (relative to the root of your repo).

[build]

  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and
  # assets generated by the build. This is relative to the base
  # directory if one has been set, or the root directory if
  # a base has not been set. This sample publishes the directory
  # located at the absolute path "root/project/build-output"

  publish = "dist/"

  # Default build command.
  command = "npm run build"
